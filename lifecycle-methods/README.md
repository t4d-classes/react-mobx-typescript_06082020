# React Component Lifecycle Demos

## Overview

This project will explore the various React component lifecycle methods and their functional component equivalent using hooks (where possible).

## Requirements

- Node.js Version 10 or later
- NPM Version 6 or later
- Text Editor (Visual Studio Code is recommended)
- Google Chrome Web Browser

## Getting Started

1. Unzip the archive (if you downloaded as a zip file). Open a terminal window, change into the folder with the `package.json` file. Install the NPM packages.

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the web application.

```bash
npm start
```

3. The application should open your default web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). If it does not, or your default web browser is not Chrome, then please open Google Chrome and browse to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

4. To view the performance details, open Chrome's Developer Tools by clicking the 3-dot menu in the upper right-hand corner, clicking `More Tools`, and then clicking the `Developer Tools`. Then click on the `Console` tab to view the output of the web app to the console. Click on the `Performance` tab to profile the execution and view when the methods execute.
